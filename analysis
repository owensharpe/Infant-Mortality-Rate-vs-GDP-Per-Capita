Consensus and Limitations 

Consensus:
i. Based on the data presented, as well as looking at the linear regression graphs, there is some correlation between a country's GDP per capita and their infant mortality rate.
ii. There seems to be more correlation value for countries with a lesser GDP per capita, meaning a country with less economic prosperity sees a higher infant mortality rate.
iii. However, this does not mean that these two variables are a direct cause and effect of each other. There could be a wide range of other factors affecting it.


Limitations
i. Measurement errors: mistakes during data collection or recording can introduce inaccuracies.For instance, human error in manual data entry or faulty sensors in data collection devices, like missing digits in certain values.
ii. Outliers: anomalies or outliers in the dataset can skew statistical analysis and modeling, impacting the generalization of findings, like equitorial guinea, for example.
iii. Time-dependent data: for time-series data, like our dataset, inconsistencies in timestamps or changes in patterns over time might lead to errors if not handled appropriately.
